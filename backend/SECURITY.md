## Authentication

### JWT Authentication
- **Implementation**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with HS256 algorithm
- **Token Expiration**: 
  - Access Token: 15 minutes
  - Refresh Token: 7 days
- **Secret Rotation**: Automatic JWT secret rotation with versioning
- **Token Invalidation**: Immediate token revocation on logout

### Password Security
- **Hashing**: BCrypt with work factor of 10
- **Requirements**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Status**: Recommended but not required
- **Implementation**: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Roles**: 
  - `admin`: Full system access
  - `user`: Standard user access
  - `guest`: Limited read-only access

### Permission Model
- Fine-grained permissions for each API endpoint
- Automatic role-based permission checking

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)
- **At Rest**: Database encryption enabled
- **Sensitive Data**: Field-level encryption for PII

### Input Validation
- Request validation using express-validator
- Protection against:
  - SQL Injection
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
  - NoSQL Injection

### Data Sanitization
- Automatic sanitization of all user inputs
- HTML escaping for output
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication Endpoints**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Public API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **API Keys**: Required for external access

### CORS Policy
- Strict origin validation
- Preflight request handling
- Credentials support

### Security Headers
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

## Database Security

### Connection Security
- Enforced SSL/TLS in production
- Connection pooling with limits
- Query timeouts

### Data Access
- Parameterized queries only
- Read replicas for scaling
- Regular backups with encryption

### Schema Security
- Least privilege principle for database users
- Separate schemas for different services
- Row-level security where applicable

## Logging and Monitoring

### Security Events
- Failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Password changes
- Permission changes
- Sensitive operations

### Log Retention
- 30 days for application logs
- 1 year for security logs
- Centralized log management

### Alerting
- Real-time alerts for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Unusual access patterns
  - Security policy violations
  - System anomalies

## Secure Development

### Dependencies
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Pinned dependency versions
- Automatic security updates

### Code Review
- Required for all security-sensitive changes
- Static code analysis
- Security checklist verification

### Secrets Management
- Environment variables for configuration
- No hardcoded secrets
- Secret rotation policies

## Testing Security

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for security features
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Penetration testing

### Test Data
- Separate test database
- No production data in tests
- Data anonymization

### Security Scans
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Immutable infrastructure
- Regular security patching

### Network Security
- Firewall rules
- VPC configuration
- Network segmentation

### Container Security
- Minimal base images
- Non-root user
- Read-only filesystem where possible

## Incident Response

### Reporting
- Security contact: security@cloudcam.example.com
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Bug bounty program

### Response Plan
1. **Identification**: Detect and confirm the incident
2. **Containment**: Limit the impact
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
4. **Recovery**: Restore services
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-mortem analysis

### Communication
- Internal stakeholders
- Affected users
- Regulatory bodies (if applicable)

## Compliance

### Standards
- OWASP Top 10
- GDPR
- CCPA
- HIPAA (if applicable)
- PCI DSS (if applicable)

### Audits
- Annual security audit
- Third-party penetration testing
- Compliance certification

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit secrets to version control
2. Use prepared statements for database queries
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Operations
1. Regular security patching
2. Monitor security advisories
3. Regular backup testing
4. Access control reviews
5. Security training for staff
